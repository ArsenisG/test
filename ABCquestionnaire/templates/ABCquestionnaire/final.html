    <li>The 17 questions you filled in were intended to try and describe dimensions of Academic
      Behavioural Confidence (ABC)<br>(related to the self-concept and self-efficacy of students)
    </li>
    <li>The identified four dimensions of ABC, are: <br>
	  </li>
      <ul>
      <li>Grades-Grd ("Confidence in the actual activity contributing directly to what a student is graded on, including coursework and exams")</li> 
      <li>Verbalising-Vrb ("Confidence in the ability to verbalise their knowledge during their learning activity")</li> 
      <li>Attendance-Att ("Confidence in the willingness to appropriately attend events during their learning activity")</li> 
      <li>Studying-Std ("Confidence in undertaking the self-orginised activity necessary for their learning experience")</li>
      </ul>
    <li>The results of your 17 responses are shown in the below constellation graph plot 
      (different number of the questions relate<br>to the different dimensions)
      (each line of points joins the responses from different sets of questions).

    <li>The base line of the constellation graph shows the index values of different confidence dimensions, 
      over the consistent domain 0.0<br>(low confidence) to 1.0 (high confidence).
    </li>
    <li>Have a look at your results and think whether they are a fair reflection of your confidences in these regards.
    </li>
    <li>You may want to talk to your personal tutor about these results - or ask your undergraduate office for where further advice<br>could be sought.
